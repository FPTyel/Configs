[CS:GO] ze_666_crazy_escape_v2_4 - ColorCorrection
```"ze_666_crazy_escape_v2_4"
More saturation, less lights, and a little bit of red colors are implemented (to looks like a real hell)

Little advice: Stripper does NOT include fixes for map. Only ColorCorrection added.

Direction for CC: csgo - materials - correction
