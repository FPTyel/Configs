[CS:GO] ze_ffxii_ridorana_cataract_t5_3_w6 - ColorCorrection
```"ze_ffxii_ridorana_cataract_t5_3_w6"
Makes map looks like more fantasy: more warm colors \ better saturation.

Little advice: Stripper does NOT include fixes for map. Only ColorCorrection added.

Direction for CC: csgo - materials - correction
