[CS:GO] ze_harry_potter_v2_1_csgo - ColorCorrection
```"ze_harry_potter_v2_1_csgo"
Makes map looks like more freshy: 
- better colors \ lights 
- lighter textures are slightly darker
- dark textures are not changed \ slightly color changed
- overall colors are now more warm \ more saturation 

Little advice: Stripper does NOT include fixes for map. Only ColorCorrection added.

Direction for CC: csgo - materials - correction
