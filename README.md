List of strippers:
```"Strippers"
	[CS:S] ze_ffxii_westersand_v8_zeta1 - Unknown Mode
	[CS:S] ze_ffvii_mako_russianversion134
	[CS:GO] ze_Fapescape_rote - Hell Difficulty
	[CS:GO] ze_Tyranny_v5_2k3 - Rage mode
	[CS:GO] ze_Paramina_rift_r4 - ColorCorrection
```

Usually trying to add something new to ZombieEscape, to make it more entertaining.

Feel free to play new modes \ difficulties to test yourself! :)

ColorCorrection is good way to make map look more realistic \ fantasy. If you want to use it - feel free to download. To make it work, pack every file to bz2 and upload to FastDL, because every player must download it.
