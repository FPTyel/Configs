Archive - As it says - Archive of my non-released or released work, and original colorcorrection to build it easy. Most of all - it is for colorcorrection backup

BalanceCorrection_Fixes - Contain fixes \ balance correction for maps, which is very helpful \ must-have to play map as well.

ColorCorrections - Contain color corrections for maps, to make them looks more freshy \ fantasy \ realistic.

Modes_Difficulties - Contain new modes \ difficulties are maded to test yourself by fresh gameplay. Very useful for events, if you never played them tho.

Usually trying to add something new to ZombieEscape, to make it more entertaining.

If you want to use colorcorrection - make sure to pack every file to bz2 (from "correction" folder) and upload to FastDL, because every player must download it.
