```

Usually trying to add something new to ZombieEscape, to make it more entertaining.

Feel free to play new modes \ difficulties to test yourself! :)

ColorCorrection is good way to make map look more realistic \ fantasy. If you want to use it - feel free to download. To make it work, pack every file to bz2 and upload to FastDL, because every player must download it.

[CS:S] ze_ffxii_westersand_v8_zeta1 - Unknown Mode
```"Westersand_v8_zeta1"
	Simply making ze_ffxii_westersand_v8_zeta1 harder

	After starting map - press "Insane mode" button on admin room. To teleport in, type "setpos -9656 -3080 2391", and then noclip (or directly noclip in, if you know where the room located).

	If you wish to play without Insane mode - it's on your own ;)
