Hello!

As you aware already, my github become private most likely forever. 
When it happened? 18.10.2022 (DD.MM.YYYY)

What happened?

Huge falsify and lie about me spreaded in Net4all community, about "being toxic against russians", and many more trashtalk - which is specifically a big lie. Also, complete ignoring of head admin to delete all of my works on server (1 week of ignoring).

If you got interest, let's begin:

Day before, 16.09.2022 we made a speech, or "briefing", about diddle extreme to understand what \ how \ what to do \ many more questions, which is very useful (thanks to DoubleBubble). It was my idea, to have a basic understanding what to do.

At 17.09.2022 we played diddle. It was like tasting shit tbh, because we sucked hard, and even more - ruiners with items are completely set to "NO" our hopes to win. However, there were an admin, "E.T1" who constantly kicked \ banned doorhuggers in first minutes. By splicing both of these moments - event was ruined, and I got tilted hard, like "why are you acting like braindeads, no way", said that I'll leave this community (because I got tilted hard) - and left.

18.09.2022 I got an insane bullying by "E.T1" and many trashtalking about me just in speech with many players in another server. I selfmuted everyone, and shitshow begins.

21.09.2022 We played santa mini-event (how cute, E.T1 made an unofficial mini-event and switched random map into the santa eternal mode). It tooks me only 1 round to understand, that this event is a big brain move (because NPC is never been killed like lmao). I switched myself to kill NPC every round, and selfmute E.T1 to became extreme toxic (talking about "russians are pigs" smth like that), he's admin btw lmao. We sucked hard up to 1:15 score and event is ended. Did I said I got 1 day gag for no reason, just constantly telling what we're doing wrong? 

22.09.2022 Another day, another hidden switch to santa eternal by him. But now, we luckily enough (NPC are sleeping hard) made it to the end of ACT1, as I said - I keep shooting NPC all the time, and selfmute him. However, after the elevator I shot the NPC for straight ~30-40 seconds - and then run into the trigger (i can't tell him to backup, and selfmute him for being extreme toxic) - seconds later I got perma banned on server. (https://sun9-18.userapi.com/impg/2EDlPnZqaWVYdUNiX8aTI5ntF1vs3SB_JGrgww/9JoKrKpB8UY.jpg?size=1920x1080&quality=96&sign=98a9d5cca3005f1b929ee08629ce7e7f&)

Inarguably, it was my fault (need to wait a little more but who cares i got gagged lmao). But they still won ACT I. So i don't care. Even after shit leading with 1:15 score and zero understanding why we failing.

Some time later, I made an report about this (you must be registered on site to see this): https://net4all.ru/threads/zhaloba-na-admina-e-t1.4481/

And got fucked, by hearing "clown" in my side. Also, many trashtalk about me happened on private admin chat (thx for few volunteers, who reveal this to me). I can't reveal this on public, even on this github, sorry.

Funny to hear that after few years of helping this project (not only financial), and many more - head admin after my private report to him - simply ignored the report, cleared my ban like "nothing happened" and said - unbanned. What a shitshow.

(russian video, no captions, sorry!) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gApvCm8iNLU - this boring video is about to start conflict. No shit about russians were spreaded. 

If they say my ideas are ruining online - I preassigned Firework (head admin) to delete all of my strippers from Net4all project. But i got ignored. So, no more updates for russians, and 
USSR - was - a - like (even being russian myself lol) (except for non-russian speakers) anymore. For other projects - you are free to use it.

This is not a nationalism, but a common sense for spit in the face.

UPD: My strippers also will contain some autokicker from map if using my stripper (via logic_auto sm_kick as server command). This is not necessary to use, but it's on your conscience.
